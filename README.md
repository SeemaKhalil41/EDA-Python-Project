Project Name: Diwali Sales Data Analysis

Project Overview:
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Diwali sales data using Python, focusing on key insights like sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. We will visualize the results using bar charts for clear, actionable insights.

Steps Involved:
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing data, remove duplicates, and convert categorical columns (like age group, gender) for analysis.
Data Analysis:

Analyze sales trends by customer demographics such as age group, gender, and product category.
Investigate which products and payment methods were most popular during the Diwali sale.
Visualization:

Use bar charts to visualize:
Total sales by product category.
Sales distribution across age groups and gender.
Payment methods driving the most revenue.
Dependencies:
Python Libraries:
Pandas
Matplotlib
seaborn

How to Run:
Install dependencies:


Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Download and place the Diwali sales dataset in the project directory.

Run the Python script or Jupyter notebook to generate bar chart visualizations.
